# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by difficulty and problem name. Most solutions are implemented in **Java**, with some in **Python** and **C++** where appropriate.

## Structure

Each solution follows the pattern:  
`<difficulty>/<problemName>/Solution.java`

Examples:
- `easy/twoSum/Solution.java`
- `medium/longestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters/Solution.java`
- `hard/medianOfTwoSortedArrays/Solution.java`

Each solution may include:
- Clean, well-commented code
- Time and space complexity
- Occasional notes on approach or edge cases

## Focus Areas

- Primary stack: **Java + Spring Boot**
- Secondary areas: **AI** and **Cloud systems**
- Strong focus on problem-solving and system-level thinking

## Purpose

This repository helps me:
- Sharpen algorithm and data structure skills
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Maintain structured coding discipline alongside real-world backend engineering work
